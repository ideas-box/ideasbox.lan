# The latest releases are giving us trouble. Version 2.0.0 is a full rewrite,
# which seems to have broken compatibility with the old NetworkManager on
# Debian Jessie.
#
# Git master has a patch to restore compatibility:
#     https://github.com/seveas/python-networkmanager/commit/cad4dc79efd8d29e9fe1f1cd03f76e61534af808
#
# However, even with that applied we still seem to encounter issues. So for
# now, we've decided to stick with the older version.
python-networkmanager==1.2.1

# We do not directly depend on typing, but resumable-urlretrieve does... on
# Python 3.4 which is our deployment target (Debian Jessie). But if we run
# pip-compile on Python >= 3.5, typing won't be added to the requirements.txt
# file. So let's add it here explicitly
