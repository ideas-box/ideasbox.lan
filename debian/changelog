ideascube (0.32.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made the StockItem.physical property a model field stored in the database;
    this should greatly improve the performance of the stock list and
    inventory pages;
  * We now accept barcodes the way they are entered by the staff, without
    trying to modify them (e.g removing special characters), as this works
    better with barcode scanners;
  * Removed the service management page, as this was confusing users and
    overall just gave them opportunities to shoot themselves in the foot;
  * Fixed the `catalog upgrade` command which was upgrading all available
    packages, even the ones which weren't yet installed;
  * Made the catalog upgrades more tolerant of failures, so that they now try
    to upgrade as much as possible instead of failing at the first problem;
  * Improved the catalog download progress indicator;
  * Added the package descriptions to the home page management view;

    upgrading them; a new --keep-downloads option was added;

    fix them;
  * Upgraded our dependencies to the latest and greatest;
  * This release is dedicated to Grégoire, who for all these years has been
    an amazing tech lead at BSF, the main sponsor of the Ideascube project; we
    wish him the best in his new venture, and hope he will remain as a friend
    in the Ideascube community;
